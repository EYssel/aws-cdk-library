The project governance of the new community-driven CDK construct library initiative by the Open Construct Foundation is designed to ensure the quality, reliability, and security of the constructs provided to the AWS community.

The governance process involves thorough reviews and stringent security checks for all constructs included in the library. This ensures the constructs that are marked as stable by the maintainers meet the highest standards and are reliable for AWS infrastructure development.

Under the careful stewardship of the Open Construct Foundation, the project will leverage the collective expertise of experienced CDK users, who will contribute to the development and maintenance of the library. This community-driven approach ensures that the constructs offered cover a wide range of L2 and L3 functionalities, extending the core library provided by AWS.

By following this governance model, the Open Construct Foundation aims to provide top-quality constructs that enhance the AWS infrastructure development experience and meet the needs of the AWS community.

## Contributor roles

The contributor roles for the new CDK construct library initiative are designed to provide clear guidance on responsibilities and ways to contribute.

**Contributors** can contribute in various ways, such as reporting bugs, suggesting improvements,  providing feedback on existing constructs, and writing new constructs. There are no formal requirements to become a contributor, though contributions will have a higher chance of being accepted if they are well prepared and show good understanding of the CDK construct library specifically and CDK in general.

**Reviewers** take on responsibilities such as maintaining existing constructs, leading discussions, and reviewing pull requests. Reviewers are chosen among those who have already contributed to AWS CDK, the CDK construct library, or who have published constructs on their own.

**Maintainers** are responsible for overseeing the entire project. They make important decisions, coordinate efforts, and ensure the overall quality and direction of the library. Maintainers are chosen among reviewers that have shown a good grasp around the overall direction of the project.

Outside of these contributor roles, there are additional roles of involvement within the Open Construct Foundation. These roles include board members and officers who oversee the organization and its initiatives. Board members provide strategic guidance and uphold the Foundation's mission. Officers decide on the direction of the foundation based on the advise from the board members and are responsible for specific functional areas like finance, operations, or community engagement.
